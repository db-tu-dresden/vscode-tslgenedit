# VS-Code Editor Extension for TSL-Generator Data Files.

The TSL-Generator uses YAML files as the data model. 
As YAML sometimes is hard to debug and maintain, the Editor Extension is meant to be used as a tool that makes life easier.

## Features

Currently, the extension supports the following features:
- Outlining (Adding relevant links of a document to the outline)
- Auto-Completion (providing suggestions of possible keys)
- skeleton-creation (creating object sceletons for complex objects)
- Preview (rendering the currently selected primitive using [ctrl]+[alt]+[p])

## Known Issues

Currently, only primitive definitions can be rendered.
